            <p>As a broker, you can generate a broker revenue share report which shows your actual revenue depending on the usage of the services you promote. The report breaks down the data to the individual suppliers who provide the services. </p>
            <p>You can use the report data as the basis for collecting the shares from the suppliers or from the owners of the marketplaces to which you published the services, depending on who is responsible for paying you according to your contracts.</p>
            <p>To create a report, use the <uicontrol>Create report</uicontrol> menu option in the <uicontrol>Account</uicontrol> menu of the <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> administration portal and choose <uicontrol>Broker revenue share report</uicontrol>. The menu option allows you to specify the month for which to generate the report.</p>
            <p>The generated report is instantly displayed at the <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> administration portal. You can choose to print the report or save it in several formats.</p>
            <p>
                <note>Contact your platform operator if the reporting functionality is not available. He is responsible for defining the respective configuration parameters.</note>
