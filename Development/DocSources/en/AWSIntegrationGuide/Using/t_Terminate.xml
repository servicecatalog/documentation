    <title>Terminating Subscriptions</title>

        <context>
            <p>A customer can at any time terminate a subscription for a virtual machine in AWS.</p>
            <p>AWS is triggered to delete the virtual server. The subscription is terminated in <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> independent of whether the deletion is successful in AWS.  Note, however, that the subscription name cannot be re-used before the deletion has been completed in AWS.</p>
