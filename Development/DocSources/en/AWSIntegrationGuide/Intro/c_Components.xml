      <p>Amazon EC2 allows customers to provision and use virtual servers on which to run their applications. Each virtual server is based on an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). An AMI serves as the basic unit of deployment for services delivered with Amazon EC2. AWS customers can either request pre-configured AMIs or they can create their own images. They can provision their images with a variety of operating systems and load them with custom application environments.</p>
      <p>When APP is deployed, an AWS service controller is also deployed, registered, and initialized. </p>
