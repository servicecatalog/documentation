            <p>As the technology provider who is responsible for the service controller, you need to have a target where the Amazon EC2 instances will be created, and to recover the so-called access keys. Therefore, you need an AWS account. For details about creating your AWS account, refer to the user documentation of Amazon Web Services. </p>
            <p>An AWS account consists of two keys, the <b>access key ID</b> and the <b>secret access key</b>. These keys are used to authenticate API calls to Amazon EC2, and must be saved in the APP database. </p>
            <p>In the controller-specific settings, you have to specify these two keys. </p>
