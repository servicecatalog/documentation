            <p><ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"

            <p>The marketplace stage can be provided as an image or as HTML code linking, for example, to animations. <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> allows you to use a separate stage for each of the supported languages.</p>
            <p>You specify the stage as HTML code referencing the desired stage image. For optimum display, you can use different stage images for desktop and mobile devices. </p>

            <p>Example:</p>

                conref="../../help/tasks/shop_editStage.xml#task634/iframe_FRAMEBORDER_0_width_task_taskbody_steps_step_3"/>
            <p>A preview function allows you to view a stage before it is published. As soon as you confirm the preview, the stage is published and visible to all visitors of the marketplace.</p>
            <p>To customize the marketplace stage, use the <uicontrol>Customize stage</uicontrol> menu option in the <uicontrol>Marketplace</uicontrol> menu of the <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> administration portal.</p>
