            <p>As a marketplace owner, you can decide to use the defined categories for grouping the services displayed on the marketplace home page.<ph audience="doc"> For details, refer to <xref
                    href="../Marketplaces/c_MPDefFeatServ.xml"/>.</ph></p>
            <p><ph
                    conref="../../help/tasks/marketplace_manageCategories.xml#task634/A_category_can_be_provided_in_task_taskbody_context_p_4_ph"
                />
            </p>
            <p>You can at any time update the language-independent IDs and the language-specific terms of categories. The new values are available immediately to visitors of the marketplace and for assignment to services. The same applies when you delete a category: It is removed immediately from the marketplace and from the services it was assigned to. The sellers of the services are notified by email about the removal. </p>
            <p>To create, update, and delete categories, use the <uicontrol>Manage categories</uicontrol> menu option in the <uicontrol>Marketplace</uicontrol> menu of the <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> administration portal.</p>
