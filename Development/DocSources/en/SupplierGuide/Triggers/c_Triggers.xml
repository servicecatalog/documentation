            <title>Creating a Process Trigger</title>
            <p>To create a process trigger, use the <uicontrol>Process triggers</uicontrol> menu option in the <uicontrol>Account</uicontrol> menu of the <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> administration portal.</p>
            <p>For configuring the triggers for your organization, you need the following information: </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Which action is to be subject to process control?</li>
                    <li>How can the notification service of the external process control system be reached? You need the URL of the notification service. This URL depends on the application programming interface used for implementing the notification service.</li>
                    <li>Is the action to be suspended until it is approved or rejected? If not, it will instantly be executed in <ph
                            conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                            />. The process control system is informed if the action for a  non-suspending trigger is executed successfully. If the action is to be suspended, <ph
                            conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                        /> will wait for a reply from the external system before the action is executed.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
