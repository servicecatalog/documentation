                                >At daily intervals, the database content is checked for organizations which have produced billing-relevant data. The data is collected and stored in the database. At monthly intervals (billing periods), the billing data is calculated. These checks and calculations are called "billing runs for customer billing data". The costs for all customer subscriptions that were produced in the course of a billing period are calculated by the billing run executed on the start day of the next billing period plus the offset defined by the operator. </p>

                                        <li>You define that the billing period is to start on the 8th of a month, and the offset is set to 5 days and 4 hours. In this case, the billing run is executed on the 13th of each month at 04:00:00.000. The start day of the billing period, and thus the billing period itself, may be different for each supplier and reseller.</li>
                                        <li>Assume, the offset is set to 0 and the billing period starts on the 8th of a month. On January 5th, a customer subscribes to a service. The price model of this service defines per time unit calculation with charges based on MONTH as well as a one-time fee. On January 20th, the customer terminates this subscription. <p>In this case: <ul>
                                                            <li>The billing run executed on January 8th calculates the one-time fee only. </li>
                                                            <li>The billing run executed on February 8th calculates the time unit that ended on January 31st, i.e. the month of January is fully charged. </li>
                                                        </ul></p></li>
