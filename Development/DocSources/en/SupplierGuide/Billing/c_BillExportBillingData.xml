    <title>Exporting Billing Data</title>
    <conbody>
        <section>
            <p>You can export the billing data from <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> and process it using billing and payment facilities that have already been established in your organization. This is the standard procedure for all customers who have decided to pay on receipt of invoice.</p>
            <p>You can export the data of one or several customers for a specific time frame. You can export the data of customers who subscribed to services you yourself have published or your brokers have published. The data can be saved to an XML file or opened in an editor of your choice. You can edit it and work with it as required. The data can be forwarded, for example, to an accounting system.</p>
            <p>To export billing data, use the <uicontrol>Export billing data</uicontrol> menu option in the <uicontrol>Account</uicontrol> menu of the <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> administration portal.</p>
