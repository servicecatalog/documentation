    <title>Terminating Subscriptions</title>
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p>A customer can at any time terminate a subscription for a virtual platform in TPS5. </p>
            <p>TPS5 is triggered to delete the virtual platform. The subscription is terminated independent of whether the deletion is successful. Note, however, that the virtual platform instance name cannot be re-used before the deletion has been completed in TPS5.</p>
