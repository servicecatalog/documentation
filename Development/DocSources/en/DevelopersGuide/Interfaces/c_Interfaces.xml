    <title>Platform Services and Web Service APIs</title>
    <conbody>
        <section>
            <p>An application that integrates with <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> invokes the functionality of the <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> platform services.</p>
            <p>In addition, the <ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> integration package contains APIs for implementing a provisioning service, an operation service, or a notification service. </p>
            <p>The subsequent sections describe the platform services and APIs in detail. </p>
            <p><ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> ships the Java interfaces for its Web services as <codeph>.jar</codeph> files. You can directly write your Java code and include these <codeph>.jar</codeph> files for calls from <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> to the application (outbound calls), or implement the Java interfaces for calls from the application to <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> (inbound calls). No code generation is required. Both call directions can be deployed in Java EE environments. </p>
            <p>The available REST APIs are described in YAML files which are shipped with <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    />. With appropriate tools such as Swagger Editor, you can view the descriptions and collect experience with the APIs. </p>
