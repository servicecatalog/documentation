            <title>Connecting to an External Process Control System</title>
            <p>If you want <ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> to connect to an external system to handle notifications and thus make use of the trigger processing feature of <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                />, the following steps are required: </p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Implement a notification service:<p>An external system that is to be notified about certain actions must implement a Web service that connects <ph
                                conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                            /> with it. The Web service must implement the notification API, which is available in the following variants:</p><ul>
                            <li>SOAP-based API, <codeph>org.oscm.notification.intf.NotificationService</codeph>.</li>
                            <li>REST API, described in <codeph>notification-rest-api.yaml</codeph>. Be aware that this API only supports <codeph>Subscribe to service</codeph>, <codeph>Modify subscription</codeph>, and <codeph>Terminate subscription</codeph> triggers.</li>
                        </ul><p>Both APIs and their documentation are provided with the <ph
                                conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                            /> integration package. </p></li>
                    <li>Deploy the notification service in your environment. You can do this on the system hosting the process control system you want to use, or on any other system.</li>
                    <li>Configure the relevant triggers in <ph
                            conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                            />. To do this, you must be an administrator of your organization in <ph
                            conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                            />. <p>When defining a trigger, you need to provide the URL of the notification service: </p><ul>
                            <li>When using the SOAP-based API, this is the URL of the service's WSDL file, for example: <codeph>https://myServer:8280/NotificationService?wsdl</codeph>. </li>
                            <li>When using the REST API, this is the URL to which <ph
                                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                                    /> can send a <codeph>POST</codeph> request for notification purposes.</li>
                        </ul><p>For details on how to define and manage triggers in <ph
                                conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/>, refer to the <ph

                                conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                            />, every action for which a process trigger has been configured results in a notification to your notification service. A trigger process key is sent for all actions that require a callback from the external system. This key is necessary to approve or reject an action. </p><p>The process triggers are queued and executed asynchronously. They are not called inside the transaction initiated by the user.</p></li>
                    <li>For approval or rejection, the process control system needs to send its response to the trigger service of <ph
                        conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/><ph audience="doc"> (see <xref
                            href="../Interfaces/c_PlatformServices.xml"/>)</ph>. The API of the trigger service is available in the following variants: <ul>
                            <li>SOAP-based API, <codeph>org.oscm.intf.TriggerService</codeph>.</li>

                        </ul><p>As a result of the response, the interrupted action in <ph

                            /> is continued or canceled. When rejecting an action, the reason for the rejection can be passed. </p></li>
