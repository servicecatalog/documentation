        <section><ph
                conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> exposes its basic functionality at a public Web service interface which consists of the so-called platform services. An application that integrates with <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> invokes the functionality of the platform services.</section>

            <p>The current version of a <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> Web service is provided in a <codeph>&lt;documentation&gt;</codeph> tag in the service's WSDL file.</p>
            <p>A compatibility layer ensures that SOAP messages received from a Web service client are analyzed, and, if required, converted to the newest format. In addition, outgoing SOAP messages from <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> are adapted to the version the client can consume. </p>

                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> Web Service Clients</title>
            <p>Web service clients must provide the version of the Web services they want to consume in the header of their outgoing SOAP messages.</p>
            <p>The version value can be specified in a configuration property of the Web service client. In case of compatible changes to the Web services in a new release of <ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/>, it is sufficient to change the version value in the configuration of the client. The client itself only needs to be adapted if there are incompatible changes. </p>
