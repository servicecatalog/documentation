    <title>External Process Control</title>
    <conbody>
        <section>
            <p>Organizations often have specific processes for registering users, subscribing to services, or defining prices. Usually, such processes include approval processes and are modeled and automated with a process control system. </p>
            <p>For certain actions, <ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> provides a way to interact with such process control systems: Triggers can be configured to be invoked when specific actions are carried out at the user interface. The triggers start the corresponding process in the process control system. If approval for the action is required, it is suspended until it is approved or rejected in the process control system. If no approval is required, the action is instantly executed.</p>
            <p>Users can see all pending actions at the <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> user interface, cancel them, or delete aborted ones.</p>
