                    <p>Templates in JSON format for the ARM must exist in the environment of the Azure integration software. A template defines the virtual machines as well as other resources to be deployed and the dependencies between them. For each resource manager template, a corresponding parameter definition file in JSON format must exist.

                    <p>The templates and parameter definition files need to be available in a location that can be accessed from <ph

                    <p>It is important to end the base template URL with a slash (/) since the template file name is concatenated with this base URL. For example: </p>
                    <p>Base URL: <codeph>https://github.com/servicecatalog/oscm-app/tree/master/oscm-app-azure/resources/</codeph></p>
