    <title>Organizations and User Roles</title>

        <section>
            <p>Each user working in <ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> is a member of a specific organization. An organization typically represents a company, but it may also stand for a department of a company or a single person. Each organization in <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> has a unique account and ID as well as one or more of the following roles: <b>operator</b>, <b>technology provider</b>, <b>supplier</b>, <b>reseller</b>, <b>broker</b>, <b>marketplace owner</b>, <b>customer</b>. </p>
            <p>Customers can register themselves with <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> or be registered by a supplier, reseller, broker, or operator. In any case, an organization with the customer role is created. Organizations with other roles can also act as customers, i.e. they are implicitly assigned the customer role. These organizations are created and assigned their roles as follows: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>When <ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> is installed, an organization with the operator role is created.</li>
                <li>Operators can assign the supplier, reseller, broker, and technology provider role to any existing organization or create new organizations with these roles. <ph
                        audience="detail"
                        >An organization can have both the supplier and the technology provider role. The reseller and broker roles, however, cannot be combined with each other or with the supplier or technology provider role.</ph></li>
                <li>When operators create a marketplace, they specify an existing organization as its owner. In this way, the organization is assigned the marketplace owner role.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The roles of an organization determine which features are available to its users at the <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> interfaces and which roles the users can be assigned. These user roles control the actions an individual user is allowed to carry out:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
