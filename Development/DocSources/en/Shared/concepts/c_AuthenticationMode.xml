                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> is installed as a SAML 2.0 service provider. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an XML-based protocol that uses SAML assertions to pass information about a user between a SAML IdP and a SAML service provider (<ph
                conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/>). With SAML 2.0, Web browser single sign-on within a company is provided. </p>
            <p
                    id="auth_saml2">All users and Web service calls are authenticated against the authentication system underlying the IdP, for example, OpenAM, Cloudminder, or Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS). The IdP provides a Web browser single sign-on profile (SSO profile) and a Security Token Service (STS). This is a Web service that issues security tokens as defined in the WS-Security/WS-Trust specification. A connection to the IdP is always established by the client (Web browser or Web service application), not by <ph
                conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/>. The client sends a request for a SAML assertion. The IdP returns an assertion authenticating the calling user. </p>

                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> marketplace or the administration portal, a <codeph>logout</codeph> request is sent to the single logout service of the IdP system and the sessions in <ph
                    conref="../Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> and in the IdP system are invalidated. The user is directed to a Web page that depends on settings in the IdP system and in <ph

            <p

            <title>OIDC Authentication Mode</title>
            <p>OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which allows computing clients to verify the identity of a user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the user. The users and their passwords and profiles are maintained at the OIDC provider, for example, Microsoft Azure Active Directory. </p>
            <p>When installed in OIDC authentication mode,  <ph
                    conref="../Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> acts as an OIDC client. All users and Web services accessing <ph
                conref="../Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> are authenticated by the OIDC provider. Web-browser single sign-on (SSO) is supported; this means that a user once logged in and verified at the OIDC provider does not need to log in again to use different applications working with that same provider until he closes the browser session and/or logs out. </p>
            <p><b>OIDC Tenants</b></p>

The first and <b>default tenant</b> is created when <ph
                conref="../Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> is installed. The platform operator can create additional tenants at any time, if required. </p>

The initial operator organization is associated with the default tenant. Users trying to log in to a marketplace are authenticated by the OIDC provider of the tenant assigned to the marketplace. For access to the <ph
                conref="../Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> administration portal, the tenant to be used for authentication must be specified in the URL unless it is the default tenant.</p>
