            </fig>
            <p>The customer has 100 users assigned to the subscription. All of them are assigned for an entire billing period. 5 users have the Administrator service role, 80 the User service role, and 15 the Guest service role for the subscription. </p>
            <p>The costs are calculated as follows: </p>
            <p>Role-specific charges: (5 * 2.00 €) + (80 * 3.00 €) + (15 * 5.00 €) = 325.00 €</p>
            <p><b>Total amount: 325.00 €</b></p>

                >This total amount is added to the base price per user in the cost calculation for the billing period.</p>
