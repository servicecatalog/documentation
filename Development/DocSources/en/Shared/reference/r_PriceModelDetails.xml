            <title>Price Model Scope</title>
            <p>Price models can have different scopes: </p>
            <p>
                <ul compact="no">
                    <li>A <b>service price model</b> is the basic price model. It must be defined for every marketable service. Without defining a service price model, you cannot publish a service. You can define exactly one service price model for each service.</li>
                    <li>A <b>customer price model</b> is specific to one customer and to one service that is used by the customer. It is not available for any other services offered to the same or a different customer. When you define a customer price model, a separate marketable service is automatically created for this specific customer only.<p>A customer price model can be used, for example, to offer lower charges to a long-time customer, or to make a new service available to a pilot customer at no charge.</p></li>
                    <li>A <b>subscription price model</b> is specific to one subscription of an individual customer. It is not available for any other subscriptions of the same or a different customer. As soon as the subscription terminates, the price model is automatically outdated. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The service price model defines the prices to which brokers and resellers are bound if they offer and sell a service.</p>
