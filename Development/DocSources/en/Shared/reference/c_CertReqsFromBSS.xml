    <title>Requirements for Web Service Calls from <ph conref="../Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"

        <section>
            <p>For the provisioning of application instances and for integrating external process control or PSP systems, <ph
                    conref="../Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> calls other Web services which can be addressed by HTTPS. In this scenario, <ph
                    conref="../Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> is the Web service client while the other entity is the HTTPS server. The following requirements must be fulfilled to establish a connection to the server:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The server must present a valid certificate: The CN (common name) must correspond to the server's domain name and it must be valid at the time of calling.</li>
                    <li>The client (<ph conref="../Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                        />) must trust the server's certificate. To this end, the server's certificate must have been imported into the client's truststore, or the client's truststore must contain a root certificate with a valid signing chain to the certificate presented by the server.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
