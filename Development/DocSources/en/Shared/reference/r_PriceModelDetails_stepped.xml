                    >Example: Stepped Prices for Users</ph></title>
            <p>In the example below, the price model specifies a recurring charge for users per HOUR. Stepped prices are applied as follows: The first 2 hours a user is assigned to the subscription costs 7.00 € each. The 3rd, 4th, and 5th hour costs 6.00 € each. Every additional hour costs 5.00 €. </p>
            <p>For the sample calculation, the customer assigns 4 users to the subscription. Each user uses the subscription for exactly one hour. The calculation would be the same if the customer assigns 1 user and this user uses the subscription for four hours. </p>
            <p>The example assumes pro rata calculation.</p>

                    width="249"/>
            </fig>
            <p>For billing, an entire period of one month is assumed. The charge for using the subscription is calculated as follows: </p>
            <p>(2 * 7.00 €) + (2 * 6.00 €) = 26.00 €</p>
            <p><b>Total amount: 26.00 €</b>
            </p>
            <p><b>Calculation with users being assigned for different time spans</b>:</p>
            <p>Calculating the costs gets more complex as soon as users are assigned to a subscription for different time spans. </p>
            <p>In the example below, the recurring charge for users is again based on HOUR:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>3 users are assigned to the subscription for 30 minutes (= 1.5 users / HOUR)</li>
                <li>2 users are assigned to the subscription for 3.5 hours (= 7 users / HOUR)</li>
                <li>3 users are assigned to the subscription for 2 hours (= 6 users / HOUR)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The sum of 14.5 hours (1.5 + 7 + 6) the users are assigned to the subscription is taken as the basis for the calculation. As defined in the first example, 2 hours cost 7 € each, the next 3 hours cost 6 € each, any above cost 5 €.</p>
            <p>The prices are calculated as follows:</p>
            <p>(2 * 7.00 €) + (3 * 6.00 €) + (9.5 * 5.00 €) = <b>79.50 €</b>
            </p>
            <p><b>Total amount: 79.50 €</b>
            </p>
            <p>The same example, but with per time unit calculation based on HOUR, results in the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>3 users are assigned to the subscription for 30 minutes (= 3 users / HOUR)</li>
                <li>2 users are assigned to the subscription for 3.5 hours (= 8 users / HOUR)</li>
                <li>3 users are assigned to the subscription for 2 hours (= 6 users / HOUR)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The sum of 17 hours (3 + 8 + 6) the users are assigned to the subscription is taken as the basis for the calculation. As defined in the first example, 2 hours cost 7 € each, the next 3 hours cost 6 € each, any above cost 5 €.</p>
            <p>The prices are calculated as follows:</p>
            <p>(2 * 7.00 €) + (3 * 6.00 €) + (12 * 5.00 €) = <b>92.00 €</b>
            </p>
            <p><b>Total amount: 92.00 €</b>

            <p>In the example below, stepped prices are defined for the parameter "Number of folders that can be created". The first 40 folders cost 4.00 € each, the next 10 folders cost 3.50 € each, every folder that is created in addition costs 3.00 €. In the example, the customer chose to restrict the creation of folders to 45 when subscribing to the service.</p>

            <p>For billing, an entire period of one month is assumed. The charge for creating up to 45 folders is calculated as follows: </p>
            <p>(40 * 4.00 €) + (5 * 3.50 € ) = 177.50 €</p>

            <p>In the example below, different prices for events are defined depending on the number of occurrences per billing period. Stepped prices are defined for the following events:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Login of a user to the service</li>
                <li>File download</li>
                <li>File upload</li>

            <p>Logout from the service and creating new folders is free of charge. </p>

            </fig>
            <p>For billing, an entire period of one month is assumed. The following events occur in the billing period: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>500 times a user logs in to the service</li>
                <li>300 files are downloaded</li>
                <li>200 files are uploaded </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The charge for these events is calculated as follows:</p>
            <p>Login: (100 * 1.00 €) + (100 * 0.50 €) + (100 * 0.25 €) + (200 * 0.20 €) = 215.00 €</p>
            <p>Download: (100 * 0.25 €) + (200 * 0.20 €) = 65.00 € </p>
            <p>Upload: (100 * 1.00 €) + (100 * 0.80 €) = 180.00 €</p>
