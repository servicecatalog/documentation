            <p>A customer subscribes to a service on Monday, 12 o'clock p.m. The subscription ends on Thursday, 12 o'clock p.m. </p>
            <p>The price model specifies a recurring charge per subscription of 100.00 € per DAY. </p>
            <p>The recurring charge for the subscription is calculated as follows:</p>

                    placement="break" width="300"/>
            </fig>
            <p>With pro rata calculation, the customer is charged with 300 €. With per time unit calculation, the costs are 400 € because each day is fully charged.</p>
