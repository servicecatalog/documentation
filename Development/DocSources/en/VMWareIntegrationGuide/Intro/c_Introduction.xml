   <p>VMware vSphere is a server and infrastructure virtualization platform that allows for running multiple operating systems and applications on a single server, the vSphere server. It gives you on-demand access to fully configured virtual machines (VMs) that are provisioned by cloning VM templates provided in vSphere. The provisioning of computing resources in the Cloud allows you to rapidly scale and flex your infrastructure to support new business initiatives or roll out services.</p>
