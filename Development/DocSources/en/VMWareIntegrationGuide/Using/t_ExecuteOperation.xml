    <title>Executing Service Operations</title>
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p>Customers can explicitly start and stop a VM in vSphere from <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> as well as create and restore snapshots. To do this, they execute the appropriate service operation from the subscription for the VM:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Start</b>: Starts the VM if it was stopped.</li>
                <li><b>Stop</b>: Stops the VM if it was started.</li>
                <li><b>Restart</b>: Shuts down the VM in vSphere and starts it again.</li>
                <li><b>Snapshot</b>: Creates a snapshot of the VM. Be aware that no snapshot versions are stored. When a new snapshot is created, the previous one is overwritten.</li>
                <li><b>Restore</b>: Resets the VM to a previously created snapshot.</li>
            </ul>
        </context>
