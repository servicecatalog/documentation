            <p>As a reseller, you can generate a reseller revenue share report which shows your actual revenue depending on the usage of the services you sell. The report breaks down the data to the individual suppliers who provide the services. </p>
            <p>The report outputs your liabilities to the other participating parties. Depending on your contracts with the operator, the marketplace owner, and the suppliers, you can use the report data for paying them their respective shares, or for forecasting the shares that they will collect from you.</p>
            <p>To create a report, use the <uicontrol>Create report</uicontrol> menu option in the <uicontrol>Account</uicontrol> menu of the <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> administration portal and choose <uicontrol>Reseller revenue share report</uicontrol>. The menu option allows you to specify the month for which to generate the report.</p>
            <p>The generated report is instantly displayed at the <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> administration portal. You can choose to print the report or save it in several formats.</p>
            <p>
                <note>Contact your platform operator if the reporting functionality is not available. He is responsible for defining the respective configuration parameters.</note>
