            <p>The data can be saved to an XML file or opened in an editor of your choice. You can edit it and work with it as required. The data can, for example, be forwarded to an accounting system. Depending on your contracts with the operator, the marketplace owner, and the suppliers, you can use it for paying them their respective shares, or for forecasting the shares that they will collect from you. </p>
