    <title>Log Types and Location of Log Files</title>

            <p>On the Docker instance we configure rsyslog to write container logs to dedicated log files on the Cinder logs volume. But currently the container logs are also written to /var/log/messages which is redundant and fills the instance's file system. We must disable container logging to the messages file.</p>
            <p><ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> writes its logging information into the standard output directory of Docker messages. </p>
