                />. Creating a marketplace includes defining the marketplace properties and assigning an organization as the owner of the marketplace. All administrators of the assigned owner organization automatically receive the marketplace manager role. The marketplace manager role enables them to administrate and customize the marketplace.</p>
            <p>As a prerequisite for creating a marketplace, the organization to be assigned as the marketplace owner must already exist.</p>
