            <p>For configuring the triggers for an organization, you need the following information to be provided by the organization that wants to use an external process control system: </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Which action is to be subject to process control?</li>
                    <li>For which organization is trigger processing to be configured (organization ID)?</li>
                    <li>How can the notification service of the external process control system be reached? You need the URL of the notification service WSDL file, for example: <codeph>https://myServer:8280/NotificationService?wsdl</codeph>
                    </li>
                    <li>Is the action to be suspended until it is approved? If not, it will be executed in <ph
                            conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                            /> and the external system will be informed about the execution. If the action is to be suspended, <ph
                            conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                        /> will wait for a reply from the external system before the action is executed.</li>
                </ul>
