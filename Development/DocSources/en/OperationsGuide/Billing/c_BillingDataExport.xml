                                    <p>You can export the revenue share data for all organizations with a specific role for a specific time frame. Based on the customer billing data calculated for the given time frame, the costs are analyzed to determine the revenue shares for the operator, marketplace owners, brokers, and resellers and their effects on the suppliers' revenues. Discounts granted by a supplier to his customers are deducted from the revenue shares. </p>
                                    <p>You can use the data to get an overview of who is to receive which revenue shares. The exported data can be forwarded, for example, to an accounting system which continues to process it. For example, you can invoice your revenue share to marketplace owners or suppliers.<ph audience="doc"> For details on defining revenue shares, refer to <xref
