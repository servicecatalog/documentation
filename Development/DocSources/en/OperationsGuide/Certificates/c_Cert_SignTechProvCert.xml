    <title>Signing an External Organization's Certificate</title>
    <conbody>
        <section>
            <p>A technology provider (or any other external organization that wants to make use of certificate-based communication) has to provide the certificate for his organization, and a certificate signing request. The <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> operator needs to sign the certificate. </p>
            <p>To sign a certificate, use <codeph>OpenSSL</codeph>. Make sure that you have access to the private key of the <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> CA root certificate and the certificate of the external organization (<codeph>tpcert.csr</codeph>). </p>
            <p>Execute the following command: </p>
            <p>
                <codeblock>&lt;OPENSSL-Install-Dir&gt;/openssl x509 -req -days 3650 
 -in tpcert.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 
 -out tpcert.crt</codeblock>
            </p>
            <p>The serial number (<codeph>01</codeph> in the sample above) must be increased with every invocation of the command.</p>
            <p>Proceed with sending the output file <codeph>tpcert.crt</codeph>, the CA root certificate, and the <codeph>bssDomain.crt</codeph> (domain certificate) to the organization requesting certificate-based communication.</p>
