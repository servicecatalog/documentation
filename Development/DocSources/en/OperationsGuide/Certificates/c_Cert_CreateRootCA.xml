    <title>Creating a CA Root Certificate for <ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"

        <section>
            <p>The creation of the CA (Certification Authority) root certificate for <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> involves the following steps: </p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create a private key with the following <codeph>OpenSSL</codeph> command:<p>
                            <codeblock>&lt;OPENSSL-Install-Dir&gt;/openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 4096</codeblock>
                        </p><p>A <codeph>ca.key</codeph> file is created in the directory where the command was executed. It contains the private key and is required for all subsequent certificate signing operations. <codeph>4096</codeph> is the number of bits the key will have. <note>Observe applicable national regulations as to the allowed number of bits the key may have.</note></p></li>
                    <li>To create the CA root certificate, execute the following command: <p>
                            <codeblock>&lt;OPENSSL-Install-Dir&gt;/openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 
 -key ca.key -out ca.crt</codeblock>
                        </p><p>Using the private key created before, a certificate file (<codeph>ca.crt</codeph>) for the CA organization is created. The option <codeph>-days 3650</codeph> states that the created certificate will be valid for 10 years. The default (if you leave the value empty) is 1 month. The certificate file must be provided to all organizations that request their certificate to be signed.</p></li>
                </ol>
