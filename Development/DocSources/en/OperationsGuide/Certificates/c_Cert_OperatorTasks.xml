                <ul>
                    <li>You have a Java environment installed of the Java version supported by <ph
                            conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                        />. This is required for creating, exporting and importing certificates. </li>
                    <li>A tool for signing certificates is installed in your environment, for example <codeph>OpenSSL</codeph> (<codeph>http://www.openssl.org/</codeph>). The samples mentioned in the next sections assume that <codeph>OpenSSL</codeph> is installed. </li>
                    <li>You have moved the keystore and truststore files in the application server domain where <ph

Check for the files<p><codeph>&lt;GLASSFISH_HOME&gt;/glassfish/domains/bes-domain/config/cacerts.jks</codeph> and</p><p><codeph>&lt;GLASSFISH_HOME&gt;/glassfish/domains/bes-domain/config/keystore.jks</codeph>.</p>If they are present, move them to a temporary directory.</li>
