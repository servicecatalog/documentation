      <ul compact="no">
        <li>The maximum number of concurrent users of the subscription has been reached. For example, 5 users are allowed to use the service concurrently, all of them are currently logged in, and you have tried to login to the service as the 6th user. </li>
        <li>The subscription has been terminated. It is no longer available, thus you can no longer access the service. </li>
