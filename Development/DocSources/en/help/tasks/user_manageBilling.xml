However, this is not always suitable in real business. For this reason, you can define your desired start day of the billing period.</ph> For example, if you define that the billing period is to start on the 8th of a month, it starts on the 8th at 00:00:00.000 and ends on the 7th of the next month at 23:59:59.999.</p>
