  <title>Creating a marketplace</title>
  <taskbody>
    <context>
      <p>On the <uicontrol>Create marketplace</uicontrol> page, you can create a marketplace to be operated on your platform.</p>
      <p>Creating a marketplace includes defining the marketplace features and settings and assigning an organization as the owner. The organization you assign as the owner is automatically assigned the marketplace owner role. All administrators automatically receive the marketplace manager role. The marketplace manager role enables them to administrate and customize the marketplace.</p>
      <p>As a prerequisite for creating a marketplace, the organization to be assigned as the marketplace owner must already exist.</p>
      <p>If the platform is operated in OIDC authentication mode, you can select the tenant to be associated with the new marketplace. Users logging in to the marketplace will be authenticated by the OIDC provider system represented by the tenant. </p>

      <p>The administrators of the owner organization are assigned the marketplace manager role. They are notified by email about the creation of the marketplace. The email contains two URLs. One can be used by the marketplace managers for administrating and customizing the marketplace. The other can be used for public access to the marketplace. </p>
      <p>Once you have created a marketplace, your role as a platform operator allows you to change the marketplace owner, to delete the marketplace, if required.</p>
