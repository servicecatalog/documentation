                    >(<codeph>mp.css</codeph>)</ph> and the files and images it references are provided in the branding package, a ZIP file which you can download <ph

                >on the <uicontrol>Customize layout</uicontrol> page</ph>. The branding package also includes sample HTML pages of a marketplace. You can use these HTML pages to preview and test your customizations. In the style sheet, you can find comments and descriptions of the relevant elements of the HTML pages as well as information on which elements you must not customize in order to ensure that the page layout does not get broken.</p>
            <p id="Be_aware_of_the_following:_task_taskbody_context_p_3">Be aware of the following:</p>
            <ul compact="no" id="Your_organization_is_responsi_task_taskbody_context_ul">
                <li>Your organization is responsible for providing the correct version of the customized style sheet and all referenced files to the platform operator. </li>
                <li>If the server hosting the style sheet cannot be reached, the behavior depends on the Web browser used to access the marketplace. For example, the browser could freeze or show the content without any style. <p>In order to reduce this risk to a minimum, the platform operator must ensure that the customized style sheet is stored in a location that is always available.</p></li>
                <li>When you save your style sheet settings on the <uicontrol>Customize layout</uicontrol> page, the platform checks whether the server hosting the style sheet is available and that text or CSS content is provided when accessing the URL. Be aware, however, that the platform does not check for any files and images referenced by the style sheet. </li>
                <li>A new layout becomes effective as soon as the platform operator has loaded your changes into the respective container. A user can see the changes the next time he logs in. Anonymous users need to close and reopen their Web browser. Thus, make sure that the previous style sheet is still available for some time when you update it to a newer version. </li>
                <li>You need to ensure that any Web browser accessing your marketplace is forced to retrieve the style sheet and the referenced files from the server when a new version is available and accessible from the Internet. <p>You can achieve this by adding version information to the style sheet URL.</p><p>Every time you provide a new version of the style sheet, you change the version information and thus the URL. </p></li>
