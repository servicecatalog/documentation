  <title>Localizing price model elements</title>
  <taskbody>
    <context>
      <p>On the <uicontrol>Localize price model description</uicontrol> page, you can provide and save the description and the license agreement defined in a price model.</p>
      <p>If you do not localize the price model elements, the English texts are displayed to customers.</p>
      <p>You can only localize the elements if the marketable service for which you provide the translations is deactivated. Existing subscriptions are not affected by the localization. Any changes you make are visible to customers for new subscriptions only.</p>

        >Brokers you have granted the permission to sell the service as well as their customers can instantly view the price model elements in the languages in which you provide them. Existing subscriptions to services sold by brokers are not affected by the localization. Any changes you make are effective for new subscriptions only.</p>
      <p id="Resellers_can_provide_their_o_task_taskbody_context_p_5"
        >Resellers can provide their own license agreement. Thus, localizing the license agreement does not have any effect on their service offering.</p>
