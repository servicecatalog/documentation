            <p>On the <uicontrol>Import users</uicontrol> page, you can import users from an external LDAP system and thus register them. In addition, you can define their user roles. The LDAP system is used for authenticating the users when they log in. </p>
            <p>Upon creation or registration of your organization, LDAP-based authentication must have been specified and LDAP connection settings must have been defined.</p>
            <p>The role of your organization determines which roles can be assigned to the users. The user roles control the actions a user is allowed to execute:<ul

            <p>The selected users are imported and registered. After a successful import and registration, the users are sent an email with the URL for accessing the system. They are automatically added to your organization's default organizational unit. The default organizational unit contains all users currently registered for your organization.</p>
            <p>If the user ID of a user to be imported already exists in the platform, the email address of this user (e.g. <codeph>userSmith@organization.com</codeph>) is used as user ID for logging in to the system. If yet another user with the same ID is imported, the new user ID is constructed using the existing ID followed by the "at" sign (@) and the ID of the organization the user belongs to (e.g. <codeph>userSmith@abcdefg</codeph>). The user is sent an email with the respective user ID.</p>
            <p>User data maintained in the external LDAP system such as the password, first name, or last name can only be changed in the external LDAP system. If the data is changed, the platform automatically synchronizes it. Be aware that an automatic synchronization is not possible in case a user ID is changed in the LDAP system. The user has to be imported again.</p>
