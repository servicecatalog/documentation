      <p>On the <uicontrol>Define service</uicontrol> page, you can create a marketable service you want to provide to customers. You can offer the service directly to customers or cooperate with brokers or resellers whom you grant the permission to sell the service. </p>

            <li>By selecting the <uicontrol>User option</uicontrol> check box for a parameter you can specify whether it is offered as an option to customers who subscribe to the service.</li>
            <li>In the <uicontrol>Value</uicontrol> column of the table, you can define a value for each parameter. The value must be within the range defined for the technical service. </li>

      <step>
        <cmd>Optionally, specify a <b>URL of a parameter configuration tool</b>. In this way, you can link an external tool of your choice.

        <info>
          <p>If an external tool is used, the <uicontrol>Service parameters</uicontrol> table for configuring the parameters is replaced by the tool's interface during the subscription process. <note>Make sure that the URL pointing to the parameter configuration tool is secure.

        <cmd>Optionally, specify a <b>URL of a custom tab</b>. In this way, you can add a tab to the <b>Details</b> view for subscriptions on the marketplace. This URL may point to a Web page or Web application the content of which will be retrieved and shown on the custom tab. Particularly users of IaaS services may be interested in additional details on the service and the operation of the service they subscribed to. Using a custom tab, you can provide the information needed for accessing provisioned instances, such as IP addresses, network information, or user credentials. </cmd>

          </p>
          <p>Predefined custom tabs are available for viewing details on subscriptions to an IaaS service such as OpenStack or Amazon Web Services (AWS). On the custom tab, the booked virtual systems are listed with the following information: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Header with the name of the subscription</li>
              <li>Access information</li>

            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>You can set the URL for accessing the custom tab in the following format: </p>
          <p><codeph>https://&lt;host_fqdn>:8881/&lt;service controller name>/serverInformation.jsf</codeph></p>
          <p><codeph>&lt;host_fqdn></codeph> is the fully qualified name or IP address of the host used to access <ph
              conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr" platform="print"/><ph platform="help"
              >the platform</ph>, <codeph>8881</codeph> is the port of APP. Omit the port if <ph

              >the platform</ph> is operated with its proxy. <codeph>&lt;service controller name></codeph> is the default context root of the relevant service controller and cannot be changed. </p>

          <p><codeph>https://myhost:8881/oscm-app-openstack/serverInformation.jsf</codeph></p>
          <p>As soon as a customer opens the <b>Details</b> view for a subscription to an IaaS service, the context of the subscription is returned to the URL of the custom tab with the following information: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li><codeph>orgId</codeph>: Organization owning the subscription</li>
              <li><codeph>subId</codeph>: Subscription Name (ID)</li>
              <li><codeph>instId</codeph>: ID of the provisioned instance, for example, the instance ID used in APP</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

        </info>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Optionally, specify a <b>Name of the custom tab</b> as it will be shown to your customers. The name is restricted to 40 alphanumeric characters and must not contain special characters.</cmd>
        <info/>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>To create the service, click <uicontrol>Save</uicontrol>.</cmd>
      </step>
    </steps>
    <result>
      <p>The service is created and available for further operations. You must now define its price model and specify the marketplace to which you want to publish it. After that you can activate the service to make it finally available for subscription to customers. </p>
      <p>Optionally, you can define upgrade and downgrade options for your service and grant brokers and resellers the permission to sell it.</p>
