  <taskbody>
    <context>
      <p>On the <uicontrol>Manage payment service provider</uicontrol> page, you can configure the communication with a payment service provider (PSP) and define the payment types made available by the PSP. </p>
      <p>For successfully integrating a PSP, several prerequisites must be fulfilled: </p>
      <p>
        <ul compact="no">
          <li>
            <p id="psp2">Your organization, i.e. the operator organization, must be registered in the PSP system.</p>

              >The suppliers or resellers who are to use the services of the PSP need to have a contractual relationship with the PSP. The supplier or reseller organizations must also be registered in the PSP system. </p>

          <li>
            <p id="psp3a"
              >The PSP issues an identifier for the supplier or reseller so that payments can be immediately linked to the supplier's or reseller's account.</p>

                platform="help">the platform</ph> and the PSP system is ensured.</p>

      <p><b>To configure a payment service provider</b>:</p>
    </context>
    <steps>
      <step>
        <cmd>From the <uicontrol>Payment service provider</uicontrol> list, select the PSP to configure.</cmd>
        <info>
          <p>The list contains all PSPs registered with your platform.</p>
          <!--p>After the installation of the platform, Heidelpay is created as a sample PSP. When you select <b>heidelpay</b> from the list, the sample configuration is displayed including all parameters required for communicating with Heidelpay. In order to complete the integration of Heidelpay, you need to build, deploy, and configure the Heidelpay integration adapter as shipped with the <codeph><xref format="html" href="https://github.com/servicecatalog/development/releases" scope="external"
              ><u><i>oscm-integration-psp-pack.zip</i></u></xref></codeph> file. </p-->
        </info>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Specify the configuration settings and their values needed for communicating with the PSP: Click <b>Add</b> to enter a new key-value pair.</cmd>
        <info>
          <p>The configuration settings depend on the implementation of the PSP integration adapter. You must be informed about the required settings by the PSP. </p>
        </info>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Define the payment types that the PSP offers. Click <b>Add</b>, and proceed on the <uicontrol>New payment type</uicontrol> page. </cmd>
        <info>You can add payment types, but not remove a type already defined for the PSP. The names of the payment types can be freely defined. The payment types themselves are provided by the PSP. For example, if an integration with Heidelpay has been implemented and selected, <codeph>CREDIT_CARD</codeph> and <codeph>DIRECT_DEBIT</codeph> are already present.</info>
