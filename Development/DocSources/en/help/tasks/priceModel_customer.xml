  <title>Defining a customer price model</title>
  <taskbody>
    <context>
      <p>On the <uicontrol>Define for customer</uicontrol> page, you can define or update the price model for a selected service and customer. </p>
      <p>The customer price model you define or update takes priority over the original service price model.<ph audience="doc"> Click <xref
          href="../../Shared/reference/r_PriceModelDetails.xml">here</xref> for basic information on price models.</ph></p>
      <p>Usually, you change a customer price model only in agreement with the relevant customer. For updating a customer price model, the relevant marketable service must be deactivated. Your changes overwrite the previous values. The update does not affect existing subscriptions. The changes only take effect for new subscriptions of the customer after the service has been activated again. </p>
