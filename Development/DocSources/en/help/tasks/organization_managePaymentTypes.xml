      <p><b>To add a payment type</b>:</p>
    </context>
    <steps>
      <step>
        <cmd>From the <uicontrol>Payment service provider</uicontrol> list, select the PSP that offers the payment type that you want to assign to the selected supplier or reseller organization. </cmd>
        <info>
          <p>The list contains all PSPs registered and configured on your platform.</p>

      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>In the <b>PSP identifier</b> field, enter the identifier or account number for the supplier or reseller as provided by the PSP. </cmd>
        <info>Suppliers and resellers need to have a contractual relationship with the PSP. The PSP configures the channel for a supplier or reseller and issues an identifier, usually an account number, so that payments can be immediately linked to the supplier's or reseller's account.</info>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Select the types of payment that the selected supplier or reseller may offer to his customers.</cmd>
        <info>Next to <b>Payment</b>, you see the payment types offered by the selected PSP. The available payment types depend on the configuration of the PSP.</info>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>To save your entries, click <uicontrol>Save</uicontrol>.</cmd>
        <info>
