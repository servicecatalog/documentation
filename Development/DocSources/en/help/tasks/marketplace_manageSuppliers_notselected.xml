When the marketplace is created, the organization specified as the marketplace owner is automatically admitted, provided that it is assigned the supplier, broker, or reseller role.</ph><p><ph

Existing subscriptions are not affected.</ph></p></li>
        <li><b>Open marketplace</b>: If the marketplace allows any supplier, broker, or reseller to publish services, you can explicitly exclude one or more sellers and add them to a blacklist. This might be required, for example, if a seller is in arrears with his payments. If the seller already published services to the marketplace, these services are automatically deactivated. Customers can no longer subscribe to them. Existing subscriptions are not affected.<p
