                  <p>On the <uicontrol>Add tracking code</uicontrol> page, you can add or remove tracking code to or from your marketplace Web pages. </p>
                  <p>Tracking code allows you to monitor the marketplace traffic by measuring the frequency in which the marketplace is accessed by visitors. You are free to choose your preferred Web analytics software. The menu option enables you to insert the desired HTML code for tracking the access into each marketplace Web page. When a page is loaded, the tracking script is executed and you can evaluate the analytics data.</p>
