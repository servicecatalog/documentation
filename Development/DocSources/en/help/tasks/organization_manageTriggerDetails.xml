  <title>Managing a trigger</title>
  <taskbody>
    <context>
      <p>On the <uicontrol>Manage trigger</uicontrol> page, you can define a new process trigger for your organization or change or delete an existing one.</p>
      <p>As a prerequisite for controlling actions by processes, a notification service must exist and be deployed. This service forms the interface between the platform and the process control system. For details on implementing such a service, contact the platform operator.</p>
      <p><b>To add a new trigger</b>: </p>
    </context>
    <steps>
      <step>
        <cmd>In the <uicontrol>Display as</uicontrol> field, enter a name for the trigger as it is to be shown to users on the <uicontrol>Manage processes</uicontrol> page. </cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>From the <uicontrol>Type</uicontrol> list, select the action which is to be subject to process control. </cmd>
        <info>
          <p>The list contains all actions for which triggers can be configured. </p>
          <p>For any type of organization, the following triggers can be configured: </p>
          <ul compact="no">
            <li>A subscription is to be changed, for example, renamed (<codeph>Modify subscription</codeph>). </li>
            <li>A billing run is completed, and the billing data for a billing period is calculated (<codeph>Billing run finished</codeph>). </li>
            <li>A subscription is to be added (<codeph>Subscribe to service</codeph>). </li>
            <li>A user is to be assigned to or removed from a subscription (<codeph>Assign users to subscription</codeph>). <p>For the case that a user is automatically assigned to a new subscription when subscribing to a service, no trigger can be configured. The <codeph>Assign users to subscription</codeph> trigger only applies to users that are manually assigned to a subscription.</p></li>
            <li>A subscription is to be upgraded or downgraded (<codeph>Up/Downgrade subscription</codeph>). </li>
            <li>A subscription is to be terminated (<codeph>Terminate subscription</codeph>). </li>
            <li>A user is to be registered (<codeph>Register user</codeph>).<p>Triggers can only be configured for registering single users. The import of multiple users in one operation from an LDAP system or a user data file cannot be executed under process control.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>For <b>suppliers</b>, the following additional triggers can be configured: </p>
          <ul compact="no">
            <li>A customer is to be registered (<codeph>Register customer</codeph>). </li>
            <li>The payment types for a customer are to be changed (<codeph>Manage payment types for customer</codeph>). </li>
            <li>A marketable service is to be activated (<codeph>Activate service</codeph>). </li>
            <li>A marketable service is to be deactivated (<codeph>Deactivate service</codeph>). </li>
            <li>A user subscribes to a service of the supplier organization (<codeph>Subscription created (any user)</codeph>)</li>
            <li>A user modifies a subscription to a service of the supplier (<codeph>Subscription modified (any user)</codeph>)</li>
            <li>A user terminates a subscription to a service of the supplier (<codeph>Subscription terminated (any user)</codeph>)</li>
          </ul>
        </info>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>In the <uicontrol>Target type</uicontrol> field, choose the appropriate entry depending on the application programming interface (API) used for implementing the notification service for your organization: </cmd>
        <info>
          <ul compact="no">
            <li>SOAP-based API: <uicontrol>Web Service</uicontrol></li>
            <li>REST API: <uicontrol>REST Web Service</uicontrol></li>
          </ul>
        </info>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>In the <uicontrol>Target URL</uicontrol> field, enter the URL of the notification service implemented for your organization. The URL depends on the API used for implementing the notification service: </cmd>
        <info>
          <ul compact="no">
            <li>SOAP-based API: the URL of the WSDL file of the notification service, for example: <p><codeph>https://myServer:8280/NotificationService?wsdl</codeph>
              </p></li>
            <li>REST API: the URL to which <codeph>POST</codeph> requests are to be sent for notification purposes, for example: <p><codeph>https://myServer:8081/mynotification/v1/processes</codeph></p></li>
          </ul>
        </info>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Specify whether the execution of the action is to be suspended until it is approved or rejected in the external process control system. </cmd>
        <info>
          <p>If not, the action is instantly executed. The process control system is informed if the action for the non-suspending trigger is executed successfully.</p>
          <p>Note that for the following triggers for suppliers the execution of the action cannot be suspended: <codeph>Subscription created (any user)</codeph>, <codeph>Subscription modified (any user)</codeph>, and <codeph>Subscription terminated (any user)</codeph>.</p>
        </info>
