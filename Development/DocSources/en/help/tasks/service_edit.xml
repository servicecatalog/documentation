  <title>Updating a service</title>
  <taskbody>
    <context>
      <p>On the <uicontrol>Update service</uicontrol> page, you can change all elements of a marketable service definition except for the technical service on which the marketable service is based. Updating a service also allows you to provide the service name for customers, the short description, the description, and the name of the custom tab in different languages.</p>
      <p>You can only update a service that is deactivated. Existing subscriptions of your customers are not affected by the update. Any changes you make are effective for new subscriptions only. To provide the service to customers for subscription, you must activate it.</p>
      <p>If you have granted resale permissions, the brokers and resellers as well as their customers can immediately view any changes you make to the service definition, even if you have not yet activated your service. Existing subscriptions to services are not affected by the update. Any changes you make are effective for new subscriptions only.</p>

      <step>
        <cmd>By selecting or deselecting <uicontrol>Auto-assign the subscribing user</uicontrol>, you can determine whether a user subscribing to this service is automatically assigned to the subscription after having completed the subscription process.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>In the <uicontrol>Service parameters</uicontrol> table, you can change the subscription and usage parameters for the service by editing the values in the <uicontrol>Value</uicontrol> column. The value must be within the range defined for the technical service.</cmd>
        <info>By selecting the <uicontrol>User option</uicontrol> check box for a parameter you can specify whether it is offered as an option to customers who subscribe to the service.</info>

        </info>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Optionally, specify or change the <b>URL of a custom tab</b>. In this way, you can add a tab to the <b>Details</b> view for subscriptions on the marketplace. This URL may point to a Web page or Web application the content of which will be retrieved and shown on the custom tab. Particularly users of IaaS services may be interested in additional details on the service and the operation of the service they subscribed to. Using a custom tab, you can provide the information needed for accessing provisioned instances, such as IP addresses, network information, or user credentials.</cmd>
        <info>
          <p>
            <note>Make sure that the URL pointing to the Web page or Web application for the custom tab is secure. The URL is not validated by the platform, neither for syntax nor for semantic.</note>
          </p>
          <p>Predefined custom tabs are available for viewing details on subscriptions to an IaaS service such as OpenStack or Amazon Web Services (AWS). On the custom tab, the booked Virtual Machines (VMs) are listed with the following information: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Header with the name of the subscription</li>
              <li>Access information</li>
              <li>For each booked VM: <p>

                    <li>Instance name</li>
                    <li>Instance ID </li>

                    <li>Instance status </li>
                    <li>Public IP address</li>
                    <li>Private IP addresses</li>

                </p></li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>You can set the URL for accessing the custom tab in the following format: </p>
          <p><codeph>https://&lt;host_fqdn>:8881/&lt;service controller name>/serverInformation.jsf</codeph></p>
          <p><codeph>&lt;host_fqdn></codeph> is the fully qualified name or IP address of the host used to access <ph
              conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr" platform="print"/><ph platform="help"
              >the platform</ph>, <codeph>8881</codeph> is the port of APP. Omit the port if <ph
              conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr" platform="print"/><ph platform="help"
              >the platform</ph> is operated with its proxy. <codeph>&lt;service controller name></codeph> is the default context root of the relevant service controller and cannot be changed. </p>
          <p>For example: </p>
          <p><codeph>https://myhost:8881/oscm-app-openstack/serverInformation.jsf</codeph></p>
        </info>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Optionally, specify or change the <b>Name of the custom tab</b> as shown to your customers. The name is restricted to 40 alphanumeric characters and must not contain special characters.</cmd>
        <info/>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>To save your changes, click <uicontrol>Save</uicontrol>.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>To provide the service name for customers, the short description, the description, and the custom tab name in another language, click <uicontrol>Localize</uicontrol>. The <uicontrol>Localize service</uicontrol> page allows you to provide the elements describing the service name in all supported languages.</cmd>
