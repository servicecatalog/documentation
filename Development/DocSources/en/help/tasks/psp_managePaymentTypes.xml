  <title>Adding payment types</title>
  <taskbody>
    <context>
      <p>On the <uicontrol>New payment type</uicontrol> page, you can define a payment type offered by the selected payment service provider (PSP). The payment types defined here can later be made available to supplier and reseller organizations. The suppliers and resellers, in turn, can select the payment types they want to make available to customers. </p>
      <p>You can add payment types, but not remove a type already defined for the PSP. The names of the payment types can be freely defined. The payment types themselves are provided by the PSP. </p>
