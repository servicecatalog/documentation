    <steps>
      <step>
        <cmd>From the <uicontrol>Organization ID</uicontrol> list, select the organization for which you want to view the billing data. </cmd>
        <info>
          <p>The list contains all organizations managed on your platform. </p>

            >The system calculates the exact costs for this time frame, independent of the defined billing periods. If the two dates correspond to the first day and the last day of a billing period, the costs calculated for the preview are exactly the same as calculated by the billing run for the billing period.</p>
