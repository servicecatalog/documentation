                            >The values you enter for revenue share percentages are based on agreed conditions between the operator, marketplace owners, suppliers, resellers, and brokers. You as the operator are responsible for setting correct values. It is possible to set the percentages to a total of over 100%. This might be intentional. For example, a supplier who wants to strongly promote a service for a limited period of time may grant a broker or reseller a revenue share of 80%. In addition, the supplier may need to pay 30% of the revenue to the marketplace owner and 10% to the operator. This results in a total revenue share percentage of 120 and thus in a negative revenue for the supplier. </p></li>
