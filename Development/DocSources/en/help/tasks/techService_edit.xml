For example, you could provide some introductory text and the URL of the login page.<p>Be aware of the following: If no access information was specified for the English language before, the text you enter here is also stored for English, irrespective of your current language setting. English is the platform's default language. This means that the text stored for English is displayed to customers working in any language for which no separate text has been specified. </p></li>
