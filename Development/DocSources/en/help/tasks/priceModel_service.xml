  <title>Defining a service price model</title>
  <taskbody>
    <context>
      <p>On the <uicontrol>Define for service</uicontrol> page, you can define or update the price model for a service. </p>
      <p conref="../../Shared/priceModel.xml#PriceModelTopic/concept_price_model"/>
      <p>For each marketable service, a service price model must have been defined before you can activate the service and thus offer it to customers for subscription. You can define exactly one price model for a service. You can, however, also define customer-specific price models or even subscription-specific ones. </p>
      <p>For updating a service price model on the <uicontrol>Define for service</uicontrol> page, the relevant marketable service must be deactivated. If you update an existing price model, your changes overwrite the previous values. The update does not affect existing subscriptions. The changes only take effect for new subscriptions after the service has been activated again. </p>
      <p>For granting brokers or resellers the permission to sell a service, it is a prerequisite to define a service price model. Brokers and resellers cannot change the prices you define. Resellers, however, can define a license agreement of their own.</p>
      <p id="If_you_update_a_price_model_f_task_taskbody_context_p_7"
        >If you update a price model for a service for which you have granted resale permissions, the brokers and resellers as well as their customers can instantly view any changes you make. A service that is already published is immediately offered with the new prices. Existing subscriptions to services are not affected by the update. Any changes you make are effective for new subscriptions only. </p>
      <p>
        <note>For a marketable service that is based on a technical service with the external access type, there is no need to define a price model. With the external access type, the underlying application is responsible for controlling how customers are charged for using the service.</note>
