  <title>Creating an organization</title>
  <taskbody>
    <context>
      <p id="On_the_task_taskbody_context_p_1"
        >On the <uicontrol>Create organization</uicontrol> page, you can create an organization and specify its role (technology provider, supplier, reseller, broker, or - implicitly - customer only). For every new organization, you must define a user who is to become its first administrator. This user can later register new users and assign roles to them.</p>
      <p>Depending on the role of the organization to be created, different fields are mandatory. For example, if you create a customer organization by specifying no role at all, this organization must be assigned a marketplace. The marketplace must already exist. For organizations with other roles, no marketplace assignment is required. </p>
      <p><b>User authentication and management</b>:</p>
      <p>The platform is running in one of  the following modes for authentication users:</p>
      <ul compact="no">
        <li>
          <p><b>INTERNAL</b> mode - users are authenticated by the <b>platform</b>: The user IDs and passwords of an organization are created and maintained in the platform or in an existing LDAP system of the organization.</p>
          <p id="UserMgmt2"
            >When maintained in the platform, the user data is stored in the platform's database. An organization's administrator can register new users, and, if required, request passwords to be reset by the operator. </p>
          <p id="UserMgmt3"
            >When using an LDAP system, an organization does not need to register its users manually with the platform. The organization's administrator can import the users from the LDAP system, thus automatically registering them with the platform. The users are managed in the LDAP system. The platform continuously synchronizes its information on the users. Connection settings have to be defined in a configuration file so that the platform can connect to the LDAP system.</p>
          <p id="UserMgmt4"
            >A mixture of maintaining users in the platform and in the LDAP system is not supported. In addition, the type of user management can no longer be changed once an organization has been created.</p>
          <p id="UserMgmt5"
            >The operator organization cannot use an external LDAP system. So you can always log in to the platform and change connection settings, for example if the LDAP system of an organization is not available and thus authentication against it is not possible.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>OIDC</b> mode - users are authenticated based on OpenID Connect against an <b>external provider</b> such as Microsoft Azure Active Directory: The user IDs and passwords of an organization are created and maintained in the OIDC provider system.</p>
          <p>When creating an organization, you need to assign it to the tenant representing the OIDC provider to use. Be aware that you cannot change the tenant assignment later. The user specified as the first administrator must exist in the OIDC provider system. He is automatically registered with the platform.</p>
          <p>Together with the organization, a corresponding group is created in the OIDC provider system and the user is assigned to it as a member. Additional group members can then be added at any time in the OIDC provider system. The organization on the platform is synchronized automatically with the corresponding group at the OIDC provider at daily intervals or manually by the operator. New group members are registered with the platform, where they can be assigned user roles as required. For platform operations to work correctly, a specific user can be assigned to exactly one organization and group at a given time. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>To create a new organization</b>:</p>
    </context>
    <steps>
      <step>
        <cmd>Enter the following user data for the first administrator of the new organization, depending on the authentication mode: </cmd>
        <info id="OrgAdmin">
          <p><b>INTERNAL authentication mode</b>:</p>
          <ul compact="no">

          <note>If you create an organization with LDAP-based user management, the user ID must match an existing ID in the external LDAP system. The organization's LDAP configuration determines which additional settings are required. All settings defined in the configuration must be mapped to corresponding values, for example first name, last name, email address, and language.</note>
