    <title>Integrating Applications with <ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
        /> Using APP</title>

        <section>
            <p>When integrating applications with <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                />, the instance provisioning can be done in two provisioning modes: synchronous or asynchronous mode.</p>
            <p>Asynchronous provisioning is required if provisioning operations take a long time because long-running processes or manual steps are involved. This is the case, for example, when provisioning virtual machines on a virtual machine server. <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> supports the integration of such applications with its asynchronous provisioning platform (APP). This is a framework which provides a provisioning service as well as functions, data persistence, and notification features which are always required for integrating applications in asynchronous mode.</p>
            <p>APP also includes the operation service interface for executing technical service operations on the integrated applications from the <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> user interface.</p>
