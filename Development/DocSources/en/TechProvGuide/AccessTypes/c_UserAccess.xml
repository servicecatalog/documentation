SAML assertions contain statements that Service Providers use to make access control decisions. </p>

                                                  <li>The application requests the inter-site Transfer Service (SSO Service) of <ph
                                                            conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                                                            />:<p><codeph>https://idp.example.org/TransferService?TARGET=&lt;target> </codeph></p><p>where <codeph>&lt;target></codeph> is the desired resource at the Service Provider. </p><p>Be aware that the browser/POST profile does not specify how the URL to the Transfer Service (with the <codeph>TARGET</codeph> parameter) is obtained by the Service Provider. The Service Provider must be configured so that it can obtain the URL to the Transfer Service. </p></li>
                                                  <li>The inter-site Transfer Service determines whether the user has an existing logon security context. If this is not the case, <ph

                                                  <li>The user provides valid credentials and a local logon security context is created for him within <ph

                                                  <li>The inter-site Transfer Service returns an HTML document containing a <codeph>FORM</codeph> element, where the <codeph>TARGET</codeph> parameter of step 2 has been preserved. The value of the <codeph>SAMLResponse</codeph> parameter is the base64 encoding of a SAML <codeph>Response</codeph> element. The SAML <codeph>Response</codeph> is digitally signed by the Identity Provider. This signature contains the public certificate to be used for validating the signature value.<p>It is assumed that the Service Provider has already established a security context at the Identity Provider, otherwise the inter-site Transfer Service is unable to provide an authentication statement in the SAML <codeph>Response</codeph> element.</p></li>
                                                  <li>The Identity Provider requests the Assertion Consumer Service at the Service Provider, where the values of the <codeph>TARGET</codeph> and <codeph>SAMLResponse</codeph> parameters are taken from the HTML form created in step 5. </li>
                                                  <li>The Assertion Consumer Service consumes the SAML <codeph>Response</codeph> element and creates a local security context at the Service Provider. The Service Provider must take care of validating the SAML <codeph>Subject</codeph> identifying the user and perform the required authorization. If the validation is successful and the user is allowed to access the application, the Service Provider redirects the client to the target resource. </li>
                                        </ol></p>
