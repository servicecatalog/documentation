            <p>When a customer subscribes to a service, the underlying application is supposed to perform specific steps required for the subscription and return an identifier to <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> for future reference. The term 'instance' denotes all the items that the application has provisioned for a subscription.</p>
            <p>The actions to be performed and the items to be created, if any, depend entirely on the concepts and functionality of your application. For example, if a customer creates and stores data when using your application, your application may create a separate workspace in a data container or a separate database instance.</p>
