            <p>Integrating applications with <ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> involves several interfaces for communication between the <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> platform and the technical service or application. The communication takes place in two directions: Calls from the application to <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> (inbound calls) as well as calls from <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> to the application (outbound calls). For inbound calls, the application must implement a client; for outbound calls, the application must provide a server. </p>
            <p>Before you begin, make sure that the following prerequisites are met:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The application to be integrated is installed and operational.</li>
                <li>An application server is installed and operational. </li>
                <li>You have access to the <ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> integration package.</li>
