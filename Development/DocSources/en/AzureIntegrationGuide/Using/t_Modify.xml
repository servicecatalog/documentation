    <title>Modifying Subscription Parameters</title>
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p>By modifying the corresponding service parameters at their subscriptions, customers can change the virtual servers provisioned in Amazon EC2. ###Are there other parameters to be modified except access data? What about User data execution?### </p>
            <p>The modifications are carried out in asynchronous mode. As long as the update is not complete, the status of the corresponding subscription is <b>pending update</b>. The status changes to <b>ready</b> as soon as the modification has been finished successfully. </p>
            <note>If the subscription was <b>suspended</b> before starting the modification, its status changes to <b>suspended update</b> as long as the operation is not complete.</note>
