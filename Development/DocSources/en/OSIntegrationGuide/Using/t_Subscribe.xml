    <title>Subscribing to Services</title>
    <taskbody>
        <context><p>Users of customer organizations can subscribe to the services you have created for OpenStack on the marketplace where you have published them. This results in the provisioning of a virtual system in OpenStack, as defined in the underlying technical service.</p><p>To enable the provisioning of an OpenStack instance, the customer has to enter the name of the key pair of the virtual system when subscribing to the corresponding service in <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                />. The key pair name and the associated private key are used to securely access the OpenStack instance. For details on creating key pairs, refer to the user documentation of OpenStack.</p>When subscribing to a service, the customer also has to enter a name for the stack to be instantiated. Before the provisioning operation is started, the name is checked against the OpenStack conventions or a pattern specified in the technical service definition. OpenStack generates a random number that is appended to this stack name to make it unique.<p>Depending on the service parameters, the technical service either maps to one specific template or the customer can choose from different templates that specify the resource orchestration in OpenStack. </p><p>Depending on the parameters defined for the technical service, the customer can additionally choose from different options to configure the resources for the instance to be provisioned, for example, the instance type, the number of CPUs, or the storage size. </p><p>The provisioning operations are carried out in asynchronous mode. As long as the provisioning is not complete, the status of the subscription is <b>pending</b>. The status changes to <b>ready</b> as soon as the provisioning has been finished successfully. </p><p>As soon as the provisioning is complete, the users assigned to the subscription can access the virtual system provided by OpenStack using the access information indicated in the subscription details on the marketplace in <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    />.</p><p>In OpenStack, the virtual systems created for <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> subscriptions are managed in the same way as other instances. They can be viewed and monitored with the standard OpenStack tools. Changes, however, should not be made as this may cause problems and inconsistencies between OpenStack and <ph
