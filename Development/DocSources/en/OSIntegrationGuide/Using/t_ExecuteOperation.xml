    <title>Executing Service Operations</title>
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p>Customers can explicitly start and stop servers and suspend and resume instances in OpenStack from <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                />. To do this, they execute the appropriate service operation from the subscription for the virtual system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Start</b>: Starts all servers in the OpenStack instance that were stopped.</li>
                <li><b>Stop</b>: Stops all servers in the OpenStack instance that were started.</li>
                <li><b>Suspend</b>: Suspends the OpenStack instance.</li>
                <li><b>Resume</b>: Resumes the OpenStack instance if it was suspended.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As a prerequisite, the service operations must be defined in the technical service underlying the subscribed service.</p>
            <p>Customers can view the status of all operations they started in their account information on the <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> marketplace.</p>
