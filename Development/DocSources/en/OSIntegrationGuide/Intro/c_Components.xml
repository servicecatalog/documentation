          /><p>Heat, the orchestration component provided by OpenStack, offers template-based mechanisms for describing cloud applications. Through both an OpenStack REST API and a CloudFormation-compatible Query API, Heat provides compatibility with existing template formats. The integration of OpenStack with <ph
          conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
        /> supports the AWS CloudFormation Template and the Heat Orchestration Template.</p><p>A template enables application developers to describe and automate the deployment of infrastructure, services, and applications. Collections of resources (e.g. networks, servers, or storage) can be deployed from a single template. The template serves as an orchestration document that details everything needed to carry out the orchestration. Once instantiated, the resources are also referred to as stacks.</p>. </section>
