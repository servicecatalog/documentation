      <p>In ROR, the basic configurations of virtual platforms (L-Platforms) and virtual servers for typical usage scenarios are defined by the ROR administrators in so-called <b>templates</b>. Virtual images for provisioning the virtual servers are provided in the <b>Virtual Image Pool</b>. For example, a template may define a virtual platform that has a firewall, two application servers, a load balancer, and a database server. Different templates can be made available for small, medium, and large scale operation. Users can choose a template and reconfigure it to their needs. </p>
