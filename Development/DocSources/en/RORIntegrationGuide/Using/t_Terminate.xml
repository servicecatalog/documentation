    <title>Terminating Subscriptions</title>
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p>A customer can at any time terminate a subscription for a virtual platform or server in ROR. </p>
            <p>ROR is triggered to delete the virtual platform or server. The subscription is terminated independent of whether the deletion is successful. Note, however, that the virtual platform or server instance name cannot be re-used before the deletion has been completed in ROR.</p>
