                                <li>Setting up the databases.<ph audience="doc"> Refer to <xref

                                <li>Setting up the resources in the application server and deploying the <ph

                                /> archives.<ph audience="doc"> Refer to <xref href="t_InstAppServer.xml"/>.</ph></li>
                                <li>When installing <ph

                        /> in SAML_SP authentication mode, additional steps are required. Refer to <xref
                        href="c_ConfigureIDP.xml"/>.</li>
                <li>Deploying and configuring the BIRT report engine.<ph audience="doc"> Refer to <xref

                        </ol>
                        <p>The descriptions in the subsequent sections assume that you are using the <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> setup utilities for setting up the databases and the application server resources. This is the easiest way and suitable for most environments, particularly when you are using a database management system and application server installation solely for <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/>. </p>
                        <p>In specific situations, however, you may have to set up some or all of the resources manually. This is the case, for example, if you want to integrate the <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> resources in an existing environment on an application server. </p>
                        <p audience="doc">The resources required by <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> on the application server are described in detail in <xref href="../../Shared/reference/r_AppServerResources.xml"/>. Details of how to set up the resources properly can best be obtained from the XML files which are provided for the automated installation and described in the sections below. </p>
