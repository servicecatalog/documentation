    <title>Managing Revenue Shares</title>
    <conbody>
        <section>
            <p>The revenue generated by services on a marketplace must be distributed to all participating parties. It is typically split between:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The supplier who defines the services.</li>
                <li>The owners of the marketplaces where the services are published.</li>
                <li>The brokers and resellers who offer the services.</li>
                <li>The operator who provides the infrastructure for publishing the services.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Revenue shares are defined by the operator. They may be different for individual marketplaces, specific services, and individual supplier, broker and reseller organizations. </p>
            <p>Suppliers, resellers, and brokers can at any time retrieve and export information on the revenue shares for the services they offer. They can use the data for charging or paying the other participating parties depending on the existing contracts.</p>
