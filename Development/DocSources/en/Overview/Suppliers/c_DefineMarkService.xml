            <p>If defined for the underlying application, specific parameters can take on different values which suppliers can make available to customers as different options. When a customer subscribes to the service, he can choose between these options. This makes service definitions flexible, since there is no need for defining separate services for every option suppliers want to offer. </p>
            <p><ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> supports suppliers in changing the definition of a marketable service at any time. The textual elements of the definition can be localized and made available to customers in all languages supported by <ph

            <p>Suppliers can copy a marketable service including its price model. This may be useful for offering an existing service with slightly different properties, for example, a higher service level with a higher price, or special discounts for a promotion campaign. </p>
            <p>If suppliers do not want to offer a marketable service to customers any longer, they can delete it.</p>
