            <p>Suppliers, brokers, and resellers are the companies, departments, or people who offer and sell services in <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                />. In the following, the term "sellers" is used to denote all three organization roles.</p>
            <p>Suppliers define service offerings for the technology providers' applications. They can provide the services to customers by themselves as well as address customers through brokers and resellers. </p>
            <p>Brokers and resellers support suppliers in selling their services by offering the services on a marketplace. Whereas brokers offer a service as defined by the supplier, resellers can apply their own terms and conditions. A subscription to a service offered by a reseller forms a contract between a customer and the reseller. A subscription to a service offered by a broker, however, establishes a contract between a customer and the supplier of the service.</p>
            <p>Suppliers, brokers, and resellers perform the following basic tasks:</p>

            <p>For all tasks, the sellers can use the <ph

                    /> user interface. They can also use the <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> reporting facilities, for example, for retrieving billing data or information on their revenue shares depending on the usage of the services they offer.</p>
