    <title>Provisioning Applications as Services in <ph

        <section>
            <p>After the required preparations and adaptations of the applications are finished, technology providers register the applications as technical services in <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                />. By registering an application, the technology provider makes it available for suppliers. </p>
            <p>An application can be registered in either of the following ways: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If an application does not provide any parameters, options, user roles, events, or operations, the technology provider can register it using the <ph
                        conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> user interface. Afterwards, the technology provider can update the service definition and add, for example, license information. </li>
                <li>If an application is complex and provides parameters, options, or events, the technology provider can create a technical service definition as an XML file and import this file into <ph
                        conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> using the <ph
                        conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> user interface.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After registering an application, a technology provider has to appoint one or more suppliers who are to be able to create service offerings based on the technical service. The suppliers must be known to <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                />, i.e. they must have been previously registered by the operator. A supplier can be an entirely independent organization, yet a technology provider can also act as his own supplier. </p>
