        <section>
            <p>Technology providers are the companies, departments, or people who want to provide their applications in a SaaS model using <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> to cover the business-related functionality.</p>
            <p>To achieve this goal, the following tasks must be completed: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the applications for usage in a SaaS model.</li>
                <li>Integrate applications with <ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    />.</li>
                <li>Provision the applications as technical services in <ph
                        conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Technology providers can use the <ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> reporting facilities, for example, for retrieving information on the number of subscriptions for their services or on the usage and load of the underlying applications.</p>
