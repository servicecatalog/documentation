        <section>
            <p>Marketplace owners are the companies, departments, or people who manage the marketplaces in <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                />. When operators create a marketplace, they specify an existing organization as the owner. An organization can own one or several marketplaces. </p>
            <p>Marketplace owners perform the following basic tasks: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Define who is allowed to access their marketplaces.</li>
                <li>Define who is allowed to publish services to their marketplaces.</li>
                <li>Administrate their marketplaces.</li>
                <li>Customize their marketplaces to adapt them to their organization's standards.</li>
                <li>Collect their revenue shares.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Marketplace owners can also use the <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> reporting facilities for retrieving customer billing data and information on their revenue shares depending on the usage of the offered services.</p>
            <p>The following sections briefly outline the basic tasks of marketplace owners. For details, refer to the <i>Marketplace Owner's Guide</i>.</p>
