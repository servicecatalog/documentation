                                    <p>A marketplace owner is responsible for providing legal information to visitors of his marketplace. This includes, for example, the terms and conditions and the privacy policy of the marketplace that must be read and accepted by customers when they register. A marketplace owner can enter and update these texts and provide them in all languages supported by <ph
                                                            conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                                                />.</p>
                                    <p>To suit the standards of the marketplace owner organization, <ph
                                                            conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"

In addition, a marketplace owner can customize the stage of the marketplace. The stage is the area on the marketplace where, for example, advertisements, eye catchers, or further information can be placed. <ph
                                                            conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                                                /> allows marketplace owners to provide different stages for desktop and mobile devices for each of the supported languages. </p>
                                    <p>To adapt the layout and branding of a marketplace to his organization's requirements, the marketplace owner can customize the colors, fonts, background images, and logos displayed to the marketplace visitors. The layout and branding is defined in a style sheet and in files and images referenced by it. <ph
                                                            conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                                                /> provides a default style sheet that can be used as a basis and adapted as required. An archive containing the modified files needs to be created and provided to the platform operator who uploads the files and thus makes them available online to the marketplace owner. The marketplace owner then can configure the marketplace to make the changes effective for the marketplace visitors.</p>
