            <p>Customers are the companies, departments, or people who subscribe to one or more marketable services on a marketplace. After a customer has subscribed to a service in <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                />, his registered users who are assigned to the subscription can work with the underlying application in the Cloud.</p>
            <p>Customers perform the following basic tasks which are described in more detail in the sections below: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Access the services they want to subscribe to on a marketplace.</li>
                <li>Register in <ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/>. </li>
                <li>Subscribe to services.</li>
                <li>Register service users and assign them to subscriptions.</li>
                <li>Use the services they subscribed to.</li>
                <li>Manage existing subscriptions.</li>
                <li>Pay for the services consumed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Customers can use the reporting facilities provided by <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> to get, for example, an overview on all users assigned to their subscriptions and on the billable events that occurred in using the services.</p>
