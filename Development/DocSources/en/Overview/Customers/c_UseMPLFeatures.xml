    <title>Accessing Services on a Marketplace</title>
    <conbody>
        <section>
            <p>Customers can access any public marketplaces managed in <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> as well as non-public marketplaces to which they have been granted access by the marketplace owners. </p>
            <p><ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> offers various features and functions that support customers in finding the services they want to use on a marketplace.</p>
            <p>Customers can: <ul>
                    <li>Browse the service catalog and organize the services on different pages.</li>
                    <li>Sort the services by different criteria.</li>
                    <li>Search for services in the service catalog using a full-text search feature.</li>
                    <li>Filter the services by terms from a tag cloud or by categories.</li>
                    <li>Rate and comment on services.</li>
                    <!--li>Bookmark services and share them in social networks.</li-->
                </ul></p>
            <p>Administrators of customer organizations can restrict the visibility of services on marketplaces to specific organizational units. A unit can, for example, represent a department in a company, an individual project, a cost center, or a single person. The OU administrators of each unit can further restrict the list of services visible to the other unit members.</p>
