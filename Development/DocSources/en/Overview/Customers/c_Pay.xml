        <section>
            <p>Users have to pay for the services they have subscribed to that are not free of charge. The costs are calculated based on the applicable price models and charged to the customer by the respective supplier or reseller or an authorized payment service provider.</p>
            <p>Typically, a customer has to supply his payment information before he can subscribe to a service for which he will be charged. The payment information includes the address that is printed on invoices and an email address to which invoices are sent. Depending on the facilities used for payment collection, the payment information may also consist, for example, of a credit card number or bank account data. </p>
