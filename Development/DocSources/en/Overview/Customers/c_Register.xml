    <title>Registering as a Customer</title>
    <conbody>
        <section>
            <p>There are two ways how customers can register in <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> in order to use the desired services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The customer registers himself on a registration Web page. <p>The URL of the registration Web page may have been published by a supplier, broker, or reseller, or the customer may be forwarded to it automatically when subscribing to a service on a marketplace. </p></li>
                <li>A supplier, broker, reseller, or operator registers the customer so that he does not need to do this himself.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In any case, <ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> notifies a new customer by email of his registration.</p>
