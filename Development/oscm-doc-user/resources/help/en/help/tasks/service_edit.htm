  <h1 class="topictitle1">Updating a service</h1>

  <div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>On the <span class="uicontrol">Update service</span> page, you can change all elements of a marketable service definition except for the technical service on which the marketable service is based. Updating a service also allows you to provide the service name for customers, the short description, the description, and the name of the custom tab in different languages.</p>

      <p>You can only update a service that is deactivated. Existing subscriptions of your customers are not affected by the update. Any changes you make are effective for new subscriptions only. To provide the service to customers for subscription, you must activate it.</p>

      <p>If you have granted resale permissions, the brokers and resellers as well as their customers can immediately view any changes you make to the service definition, even if you have not yet activated your service. Existing subscriptions to services are not affected by the update. Any changes you make are effective for new subscriptions only.</p>
