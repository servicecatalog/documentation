  <h1 class="topictitle1">Updating a service</h1>

  <div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>On the <span class="uicontrol">Update service</span> page, you can change all elements of a marketable service definition except for the technical service on which the marketable service is based. Updating a service also allows you to provide the service name for customers, the short description, the description, and the name of the custom tab in different languages.</p>

      <p>You can only update a service that is deactivated. Existing subscriptions of your customers are not affected by the update. Any changes you make are effective for new subscriptions only. To provide the service to customers for subscription, you must activate it.</p>

      <p>If you have granted resale permissions, the brokers and resellers as well as their customers can immediately view any changes you make to the service definition, even if you have not yet activated your service. Existing subscriptions to services are not affected by the update. Any changes you make are effective for new subscriptions only.</p>

<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>In the <span class="uicontrol">Service parameters</span> table, you can change the subscription and usage parameters for the service by editing the values in the <span class="uicontrol">Value</span> column. The value must be within the range defined for the technical service.</span>

        <span>Optionally, specify or change the <strong>URL of a custom tab</strong>. In this way, you can add a tab to the <strong>Details</strong> view for subscriptions on the marketplace. This URL may point to a Web page or Web application the content of which will be retrieved and shown on the custom tab. Particularly users of IaaS services may be interested in additional details on the service and the operation of the service they subscribed to. Using a custom tab, you can provide the information needed for accessing provisioned instances, such as IP addresses, network information, or user credentials.</span>

            <ul>
              <li>Header with the name of the subscription</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Instance name</li>

                    <li>Instance ID </li>

                    <li>Instance type </li>

                    <li>Instance status </li>

</li>

            </ul>

          </div>

          <p>You can set the URL for accessing the custom tab in the following format: </p>

          <p><samp class="codeph">https://&lt;host_fqdn&gt;:8881/&lt;service controller name&gt;/serverInformation.jsf</samp></p>

          <p><samp class="codeph">&lt;host_fqdn&gt;</samp> is the fully qualified name or IP address of the host used to access <span>the platform</span>, <samp class="codeph">8881</samp> is the port of APP. Omit the port if <span>the platform</span> is operated with its proxy. <samp class="codeph">&lt;service controller name&gt;</samp> is the default context root of the relevant service controller and cannot be changed. </p>

          <p>For example: </p>

          <p><samp class="codeph">https://myhost:8881/oscm-app-openstack/serverInformation.jsf</samp></p>

        
      </li>
