            <p id="task55550__On_the_task_taskbody_context_p_1">On the <span class="uicontrol">Customize layout</span> page, you can specify a style sheet that defines the branding and layout of a marketplace, i.e. the colors, fonts, background images, and logos. <span id="task55550__The_best_way_to_create_an_app_task_taskbody_context_p_1_ph">The best way to create an appropriate style sheet is to use the platform's default style sheet as a basis and adapt it as required. </span></p>

            <p id="task55550__On_the_task_taskbody_context_p_2"><span id="task55550__You_then_provide_task_taskbody_context_p_2_ph">You then provide the customized style sheet and the files it references to the platform operator so that he can make them available in the <samp class="codeph">oscm-branding</samp> container. When the operator is finished, he will inform you about the URL to the style sheet, which you can then specify <span>on the <span class="uicontrol">Customize layout</span> page</span>. If no URL is set, the default style sheet is used.</span>
            </p>

            <p id="task55550__The_platform_s_default_style_task_taskbody_context_p_2">The layout and branding of marketplaces is based on the Bootstrap framework and Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets). The Sass sources of the platform's default style sheet and the referenced files and images are provided in the branding package, a ZIP file which you can download <span>on the <span class="uicontrol">Customize layout</span> page</span>. <span>For details on how to proceed to adapt the sources and achieve the desired layout and branding, refer to <a href="https://github.com/servicecatalog/oscm/blob/master/oscm-portal/WebContent/marketplace/customBootstrap/README.md" target="_blank">Marketplace Customization Guide with Bootstrap and Sass</a>. </span></p>

            <p id="task55550__Be_aware_of_the_following:_task_taskbody_context_p_3">Be aware of the following:</p>

            <ul id="task55550__Your_organization_is_responsi_task_taskbody_context_ul">
                <li class="liexpand">Your organization is responsible for providing the correct version of the customized style sheet and all referenced files to the platform operator. </li>

                <li class="liexpand">If the server hosting the style sheet cannot be reached, the behavior depends on the Web browser used to access the marketplace. For example, the browser could freeze or show the content without any style. <p>In order to reduce this risk to a minimum, the platform operator must ensure that the customized style sheet is stored in a location that is always available.</p>
</li>

                <li class="liexpand">When you save your style sheet settings on the <span class="uicontrol">Customize layout</span> page, the platform checks whether the server hosting the style sheet is available and that text or CSS content is provided when accessing the URL. Be aware, however, that the platform does not check for any files and images referenced by the style sheet. </li>

                <li class="liexpand">A new layout becomes effective as soon as the platform operator has loaded your changes into the respective container. A user can see the changes the next time he logs in. Anonymous users need to close and reopen their Web browser. Thus, make sure that the previous style sheet is still available for some time when you update it to a newer version. </li>

                <li class="liexpand">You need to ensure that any Web browser accessing your marketplace is forced to retrieve the style sheet and the referenced files from the server when a new version is available and accessible from the Internet. <p>You can achieve this by adding version information to the style sheet URL.</p>
<p>Every time you provide a new version of the style sheet, you change the version information and thus the URL. </p>
</li>

            </ul>

            <p id="task55550__The_branding_of_a_marketplace_task_taskbody_context_p_4">The branding of a marketplace also comprises the stage and the texts (labels of user interface elements, email message texts, etc.). The stage, i.e. the area where you can place advertisements, eye catchers, or further information, can be customized using the <span class="uicontrol">Customize stage</span> menu option in the <span class="uicontrol">Marketplace</span> menu. The texts can be customized using the <span class="uicontrol">Customize texts</span> menu option in the <span class="uicontrol">Marketplace</span> menu.</p>
