  <h1 class="topictitle1">Creating an organization</h1>

  <div>
    <div class="section">
      <p id="OrgCreate__On_the_task_taskbody_context_p_1">On the <span class="uicontrol">Create organization</span> page, you can create an organization and specify its role (technology provider, supplier, reseller, broker, or - implicitly - customer only). For every new organization, you must define a user who is to become its first administrator. This user can later register new users and assign roles to them.</p>

      <p>Depending on the role of the organization to be created, different fields are mandatory. For example, if you create a customer organization by specifying no role at all, this organization must be assigned a marketplace. The marketplace must already exist. For organizations with other roles, no marketplace assignment is required. </p>

      <p><strong>User authentication and management</strong>:</p>

      <p>Users are authenticated against the <strong>platform</strong>: User IDs and passwords of an organization are created and maintained in the platform or in an existing LDAP system of the organization.</p>

      <p id="OrgCreate__UserMgmt2">When maintained in the platform, the user data is stored in the platform's database. An organization's administrator can register new users, and, if required, request passwords to be reset by the operator. </p>

      <p id="OrgCreate__UserMgmt3">When using an LDAP system, an organization does not need to register its users manually with the platform. The organization's administrator can import the users from the LDAP system, thus automatically registering them with the platform. The users are managed in the LDAP system. The platform continuously synchronizes its information on the users. Connection settings have to be defined in a configuration file so that the platform can connect to the LDAP system.</p>

      <p id="OrgCreate__UserMgmt4">A mixture of maintaining users in the platform and in the LDAP system is not supported. In addition, the type of user management can no longer be changed once an organization has been created.</p>

      <p id="OrgCreate__UserMgmt5">The operator organization cannot use an external LDAP system. So you can always log in to the platform and change connection settings, for example if the LDAP system of an organization is not available and thus authentication against it is not possible.</p>

      <p><strong>To create a new organization</strong>:</p>

          <li>If the user ID of the administrator already exists in the platform, his email address (e.g. <samp class="codeph">userSmith@organization.com</samp>) is used as user ID for logging in to the system. If yet another organization is created and the user ID of the administrator is again identical, the new user ID is constructed using the existing ID followed by the "at" sign (@) and the ID of the administrator's  organization (e.g. <samp class="codeph">userSmith@abcdefg</samp>). The administrator is sent an email with the respective user ID.</li>

      <p>The default organizational unit of the organization is also created. The administrator is the first member of this default unit.
