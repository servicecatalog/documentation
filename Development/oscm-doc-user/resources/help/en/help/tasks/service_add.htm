    <div class="section">
      <p>On the <span class="uicontrol">Define service</span> page, you can create a marketable service you want to provide to customers. You can offer the service directly to customers or cooperate with brokers or resellers whom you grant the permission to sell the service. </p>

      <p>Creating a service means specifying its parameters, conditions, and restrictions. </p>

      <p><strong>To create a service</strong>:</p>

          <div class="p">If an external tool is used, the <span class="uicontrol">Service parameters</span> table for configuring the parameters is replaced by the tool's interface during the subscription process. <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Make sure that the URL pointing to the parameter configuration tool is secure.

Particularly users of IaaS services may be interested in additional details on the service and the operation of the service they subscribed to. Using a custom tab, you can provide the information needed for accessing provisioned instances, such as IP addresses, network information, or user credentials. </span>

          <p>Predefined custom tabs are available for viewing details on subscriptions to an IaaS service such as OpenStack or Amazon Web Services (AWS). On the custom tab, the booked virtual systems are listed with the following information: </p>

          <div class="p">
            <ul>
              <li>Header with the name of the subscription</li>

              <li>Access information</li>

              <li>Information like the following tor each booked virtual system: <div class="p">
                  <ul>
                    <li>Instance name</li>

                    <li>Instance ID </li>

                    <li>Instance type </li>

                    <li>Instance status </li>

                    <li>Public IP address</li>

                    <li>Private IP addresses</li>

                </div>
</li>

            </ul>

          </div>

          <p>You can set the URL for accessing the custom tab in the following format: </p>

          <p><samp class="codeph">https://&lt;host_fqdn&gt;:8881/&lt;service controller name&gt;/serverInformation.jsf</samp></p>

          <p><samp class="codeph">&lt;host_fqdn&gt;</samp> is the fully qualified name or IP address of the host used to access <span>the platform</span>, <samp class="codeph">8881</samp> is the port of APP. Omit the port if <span>the platform</span> is operated with its proxy. <samp class="codeph">&lt;service controller name&gt;</samp> is the default context root of the relevant service controller and cannot be changed. </p>

          <p>For example: </p>

          <p><samp class="codeph">https://myhost:8881/oscm-app-openstack/serverInformation.jsf</samp></p>

          <p>As soon as a customer opens the <strong>Details</strong> view for a subscription to an IaaS service, the context of the subscription is returned to the URL of the custom tab with the following information: </p>

          <div class="p">
            <ul>
              <li><samp class="codeph">orgId</samp>: Organization owning the subscription</li>

              <li><samp class="codeph">instId</samp>: ID of the provisioned instance, for example, the instance ID used in APP</li>

            </ul>

          </div>


        
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>Optionally, specify a <strong>Name of the custom tab</strong> as it will be shown to your customers. The name is restricted to 40 alphanumeric characters and must not contain special characters.</span>
         
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>To create the service, click <span class="uicontrol">Save</span>.</span>
      </li>
</ol>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The service is created and available for further operations. You must now define its price model and specify the marketplace to which you want to publish it. After that you can activate the service to make it finally available for subscription to customers. </p>

      <p>Optionally, you can define upgrade and downgrade options for your service and grant brokers and resellers the permission to sell it.</p>
