  <div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>On the <span class="uicontrol">Define service</span> page, you can create a marketable service you want to provide to customers. You can offer the service directly to customers or cooperate with brokers or resellers whom you grant the permission to sell the service. </p>

      <p>Creating a service means specifying its parameters, conditions, and restrictions. </p>

      <p><strong>To create a service</strong>:</p>

          <p>Predefined custom tabs are available for viewing details on subscriptions to an IaaS service such as OpenStack or Amazon Web Services (AWS). On the custom tab, the booked Virtual Machines (VMs) are listed with the following information: </p>

          <div class="p">
            <ul>
              <li>Header with the name of the subscription</li>

              <li>Access information</li>

              <li>For each booked VM: <div class="p">
                <ul>
                  <li>Instance name</li>

                  <li>Instance ID </li>

                  <li>Instance type </li>

                  <li>Instance status </li>

                  <li>Public IP address</li>

                  <li>Private IP addresses</li>

              </div>
</li>

            </ul>

          </div>

          <p>You can set the URL for accessing the custom tab in the following format: </p>

          <p><samp class="codeph">https://&lt;app-host-name&gt;:8881/&lt;service controller name&gt;/serverInformation.jsf</samp></p>

          <p>For example: </p>

          <p><samp class="codeph">https://MyAPPHost:8881/oscm-app-openstack/serverInformation.jsf</samp></p>

          <p>As soon as a customer opens the <strong>Details</strong> view for a subscription to an IaaS service, the context of the subscription is returned to the URL of the custom tab with the following information: </p>

          <div class="p">
            <ul>
              <li><samp class="codeph">orgId</samp>: Organization owning the subscription</li>

<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>Optionally, specify a <strong>Name of the custom tab</strong> as it will be shown to your customers. The name is restricted to 40 alphanumeric characters and must not contain special characters.</span>
         
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>To create the service, click <span class="uicontrol">Save</span>.</span>
      </li>
</ol>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The service is created and available for further operations. You must now define its price model and specify the marketplace to which you want to publish it. After that you can activate the service to make it finally available for subscription to customers. </p>

      <p>Optionally, you can define upgrade and downgrade options for your service and grant brokers and resellers the permission to sell it.</p>
